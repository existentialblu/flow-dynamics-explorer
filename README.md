# Flow Dynamics Explorer

An alternative CPAP/BiPAP data analysis tool focused on advanced respiratory pattern analysis.

## What is this?

Flow Dynamics Explorer is designed to capture breathing patterns that standard AHI-based metrics miss, particularly for high loop gain presentations and UARS.

Unlike traditional sleep apnea analysis tools that focus primarily on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), Flow Dynamics Explorer emphasizes:
- Respiratory periodicity and regularity patterns
- Enhanced flow limitation detection
- Estimated arousal index from breathing pattern changes
- Minute ventilation dynamics

## Status

Early development - design phase.

## Why?

Standard OSCAR metrics don't capture what's actually happening for many users, especially those with high loop gain or UARS presentations. This tool aims to quantify the patterns that correlate with how you actually feel.
